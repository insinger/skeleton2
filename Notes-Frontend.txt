Frontend Notes
--------------
index.html
	- contains breadbar view HTML & CSS
	- defines breadcrumb area
	- defines menu (for login/logout)
	- defines stash dictionary
	- the Angular controller for this view is index.js (called IndexCtrl).

index.js
	- adds the IndexCtrl controller to the main Angular app module.
	- adds model (vm) to stash dictionary
	- sets initial state of breadcrumb text
	- switches view/state in response to menu on breadbar.

app.js
	- defines main Angular app module
	- attaches additional modules/directives, incl. ui.router
	- defines the states/views


For each new View
-----------------
Create directory [app/viewname_feature]
	Inside create [viewname_view.html]
	Inside create [viewname_controller.js]
		In the controller set the breadcrumb text through the stash dictionary.
Add line to end of [index.html] to load [viewname_controller.js].
Add line to end of [app.js] to register the view/state with UI router.
Create Service if data needs to be persisted/exchanged with back-end.
	Create functions in [viewname_controller.js] to invoke functions in [viewname_service.js].
	Inject Service into [viewname_controller.js].


For each new Service
--------------------
Inside directory [app/services]
	Create [viewname_service.js]
		Create functions in [viewname_service.js] to do $http.get/post/put/delete to backend (routes.js).
Add line to end of [index.html] to load [viewname_service.js].
