Notes for the back end when starting new projects...


DATABASE NAME
-------------
Update DATABASE_NAME in [config/development.js].
For production the name should be in environment var. See [config/production.js].
Other than this it shouldn't be necessary to touch [config/development.js].

For each Database Table
-----------------------
Create a Sequelize model, in [models/modelname.js]. Maybe set:
    timestamps: false,
	 freezeTableName: true
Create the tables in the database with the Modelname.sync() method. 
	Modelname.sync({force:true}) will drop and remake the table.
Add a sequelize.import() line to [db.js] for each model.

For each REST route
-------------------
Add new controller files in [/api] - e.g. [api/controllername.js].
	The controllers contain create/read/update/destroy/search functions that 
	carry out the required actions on the database.
	NB each function has a parameter which is a dictionary with all 
	sequelize models in it. Make sure to use dbmodels.correct_model.read() etc.
Add the endpoint in [routes.js].
  Define an Express GET/PUT/POST/DELETE handler for each endpoint, and
  connect it to the corresponding controller functions in [/api/controllername.js].


SUMMARY

app.js                - no need to touch
config/development.js - only update DATABASE_NAME

models/modelname.js   - for each table/model
db.js                 - for each table/model
api/controllername.js - for each table/model/REST resource
routes.js             - for each table/model/REST resource
